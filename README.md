# Resume_Format_in_Python
This repository contains a Python script that displays a resume in the console.


The script is designed to showcase a resume's various sections, including personal information, objective, education, skills, projects, contributions, achievements, and self-improvement. It also includes a Sanskrit greeting and closing quote to add a unique touch.
